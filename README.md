# Labview-Projects
This Repo consists of Labview Projects
* LABVIEW - Laboratory Virtual Instrument Engineering Workbench
* It is a platform for visual programming from National Instruments.
* LabVIEW reduces the complexity of programming, so you can focus on our engineering problems. It enables us to immediately visualize results with a built-in, drag-and-drop UI.
* We can develop the project prototypes, run simulations, and develop utilities.

# My Projects
* Snake and Ladders:
  Developed the entire Snake and Ladders game for multiple players in an optimized way with minimal connections
* Air Cooler:
  Created the action sequences with GIFs corresponding to the remote buttons.
* Misc:
  Here you can find all the mini projects that I have created using NI Labview.
